# PASITHEA
PASITHEA is a framework to add a vocal assistant in an Android app or service.\
This framework is based on the native Android API for the low-level mechanisms that carry out the speech recongition (SpeechRecongizer) and the text to speech (TextToSpeech).\
On top of these functions we created a set of methods to execute different types of operations. All these methods are customizables which makes the framework fully modular. It can adapt to all the kind of needs.
